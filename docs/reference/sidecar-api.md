# Sidecar API Reference

The Citadel Sidecar is a lightweight Node.js server that runs alongside the DayZ dedicated server. It translates HTTP API calls into file-based commands that the `@CitadelAdmin` mod can execute.

**Default port:** `9100`

## Authentication

All endpoints require an API key passed in the `X-API-Key` header:

```
X-API-Key: your-sidecar-api-key
```

Configure the key via the `INHOUSE_API_KEY` environment variable on both the backend and sidecar.

## Command Flow

When the sidecar receives an action request:

1. Generates a unique command ID
2. Writes a JSON file to `$profile:Citadel/commands/{id}.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "cmd-abc123",
     "action": "heal",
     "params": { "steamId": "76561198012345678" },
     "timestamp": 1700000000000
   }
   ```
3. Watches for `$profile:Citadel/responses/{id}.json`
4. Returns the response content when the mod writes it (or times out after 10s)
